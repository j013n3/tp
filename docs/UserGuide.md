# User Guide

## Introduction

PulsePilot is a **desktop app for tracking health-related information, optimised for users via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**. If one can type fast, you can key in and track health-related information faster than traditional GUI applications installed on your phone or computer.

1. Ensure that you have the latest Java 11.
2. Download the latest `pulsepilot.jar`.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for PulsePilot.
4. Open a command terminal (either cmd.exe or bash), cd to the folder with `pulsepilot.jar` in it, and use `java -jar pulsepilot.jar` to run the application.
5. The welcome message for PulsePilot should be printed to the screen.
6. Type commands in the command line and press Enter to execute it. Using `help` and pressing Enter will print the help message.

* `DATE` is in `DD-MM-YYYY` format (i.e. `19-03-2024`).


Examples:
* `health /h:bmi /height:1.70 /weight:75.42 /date:19-03-2024`
* `health /h:bmi /date:19-03-2024 /height:1.70 /weight:75.42`

Expected Output:
```

## Logging

The latest logs are written to `pulsepilot_log.txt` once the bot exits. Each time the bot is run, the current 
`pulsepilot_log.txt` file is overwritten with the most recent logs. The logs record both info messages and any error messages.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Saving Data

Data is saved to `pulsepilot_data.txt` once the bot exits. Each time the bot exits, the current 
`pulsepilot_data.txt` file is overwritten with the most recent data.

**Warning:** Should this file be corrupted,there is a slim chance of recovery.
**Tip:** Ensure that you always have a _backup copy stored safely_ to prevent permanent data loss.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## FAQ

**1.** How do I transfer my data to another computer?

Ensure that the `pulsepilot.jar` is placed in the **same folder** as `pulsepilot_data.txt`. PulsePilot should recognise
and synchronise your data contents from `pulsepilot_data.txt` if done correctly.

**Tip:** Create a _backup copy_ to prior to file transfer to avoid data corruption.

**2.** What happens if my data is corrupted?

Depending on the severity of corruption, you may experience 2 scenarios:

- A full corruption
```

|_)    |  _  _ |_) o  |  _ _|_

____________________________________________________________
```
- A partial corruption
```

____________________________________________________________
Exception Caught!
Error: File is corrupted! Ceasing any further data imports...
Some data may have been recovered. PulsePilot shall resume.
____________________________________________________________
```

In either case, you may want to overwrite/replace the current `pulsepilot_data.txt` with that of your backup in order to restore your data.


A full corruption indicates permanent and complete data loss. Please delete `pulsepilot_data.txt` and relaunch PulsePilot.

A partial corruption indicates a partial recovery of data up until the point of corruption. We recommend utilising the `history` command to review and discrepancies
and missing data. You may choose to re-enter the corrupted data to be saved again upon `exit`.

(hyperlink for history and exit)

**3.** Is my tracking data private and confidential?

Yes, your data is secure and stored locally on your machine. PulsePilot does not have any features that would allow it to send your data elsewhere.

**4.** What Java version is required to run PulsePilot?

PulsePilot requires at least Java version 11.

**5.** Can I use the application offline?

Yes, PulsePilot works perfectly offline. All data are stored on your device for better privacy.
